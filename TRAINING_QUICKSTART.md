## ⚙️ Understanding Trading Rules

The simulator enforces **realistic trading rules** to teach you discipline:

### 1. Commission (Default: 0.1%)
**What it means**: Every trade costs money, even if you break even on price.

**Example**: 
- Buy 1 Gold @ $2,050 = $2,050 + $2.05 commission = **$2,052.05 total**
- Sell 1 Gold @ $2,050 (same price!) = $2,050 - $2.05 commission = **$2,047.95 received**
- **Net Loss: $4.10 from commissions alone!**

**Lesson**: Trade less frequently, make each trade count.

### 2. Minimum Time Gap (Default: 5 minutes)
**What it means**: You must wait 5 minutes between trades.

**Why**: Prevents emotional overtrading. Professional traders don't react to every price tick.

**If Blocked**: You'll see "⏰ Wait X more minutes" with explanation.

### 3. Max Position Size (Default: 50% of capital)
**What it means**: You can't put more than 50% of your initial capital into one trade.

**Example**: With $5,000 capital, you can't spend more than $2,500 on a single asset.

**Why**: Diversification and risk management. Never "all in" on one bet.

### 4. Cooldown After Loss (Default: OFF)
**What it means**: Optional rule that makes you wait after losing trades.

**Why**: Prevents "revenge trading" - trying to immediately win back losses.

**To Enable**: Go to ⚙️ Settings and adjust the cooldown slider.

A: Create a new session with any amount you want. It's for learning!

## 🎓 Pro Tips

1. **Start Conservative**  
   Don't trade all your capital immediately. Keep reserves.

2. **Track Your Reasoning**  
   Use the Notes field (future feature) to record why you made each trade.

3. **Learn From Losses**  
   Every loss teaches something. Review losing trades to see patterns.

4. **Commission Adds Up Fast**  
   Two round trips = 4 commissions. That's 0.4% of capital gone!

5. **Win Rate Is Overrated**  
   Better to win big 40% of the time than win small 80% of the time.

6. **Position Sizing Is King**  
   Risk management > prediction accuracy.

7. **Patience Pays**  
   The time gap rule is your friend, not your enemy.
